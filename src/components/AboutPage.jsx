      <h2>About ShareMyMeal 🍽️</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Food is precious</strong> — every meal shared through <strong>ShareMyMeal</strong> can make a real difference in someone’s life. This platform is built to reduce food waste and connect communities by making extra food available to those who need it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone can share leftover food by simply clicking on the map, selecting a location, and filling out a short form with a description and contact details. These shared meals are then visible to others in real-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        To maintain freshness and fairness, all food pins automatically disappear after 3 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Please be honest.</strong> Do not share fake locations or misleading information. Our goal is to help people genuinely — not to create false hope. Let’s use this platform responsibly and with compassion.
      </p>
